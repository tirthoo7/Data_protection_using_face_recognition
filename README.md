# Data_protection_using_face_recognition

I have implemented the data protection functionality with face recognition technology. In which you can add your face and later you can use that to see protected data with your face. Multiuser functionality is also implemented so more than one user has access to the same data. All of this is implemented in the 
python GUI so end-user can easily access.
Currently, private data is in GUI form but it can be extendible for opening a particular private file.
